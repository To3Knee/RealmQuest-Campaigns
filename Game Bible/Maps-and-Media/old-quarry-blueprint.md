# 🗺️ Blueprint: The Old Quarry & The Screaming Arch

## 📍 Level 1: The Surface (The Spiral)
* **Visuals:** A deep, jagged mining pit with abandoned scaffolding and rusted tools.
* **Key Feature:** The "Blast Zone." A heavy iron door with the Portalist seal has been blown **outward** from the tunnels below, indicating the pressure came from inside the earth.

## 📍 Level 2: The Tunnels (The Veins)
* **Atmosphere:** Damp, narrow, and claustrophobic. The air hums with a low-frequency vibration that makes the teeth ache.
* **Encounter Zone:** Narrow chokepoints perfect for **Filth-Vested Stalkers** to ambush travelers.

## 📍 Level 3: The Vault (Before-Time Ruins)
* **Architecture:** Massive, smooth-stone architecture that defies natural erosion.
* **The Anomaly:** A hovering obsidian shard pulsing with violet light, located where a Portalist anchor once stood. This is the source of the "Scream."
