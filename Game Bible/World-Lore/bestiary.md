## 🐺 Filth-Vested Stalker
**Classification:** Corrupted Beast / Filth-Marked
**Danger Level:** 🟠 Moderate (Pack Hunters)

**Description:** Once ordinary wolves or large hounds, these creatures have been exposed to leaking energy from "Before Time" ruins or intentional Filth Pacts. Their fur is matted with a black, tar-like substance, and their skin cracks to reveal glowing green necrotic energy beneath.

**Observed Abilities:**
* **Shadow Veil:** They can become semi-translucent in dim light, making them difficult to track.
* **Corrosive Bite:** Their saliva carries a magical rot that slows healing.
* **Resonance:** They are drawn to magical signatures, such as Portalist arches or ancient relics.

**Weaknesses:** * **Radiant Energy:** They recoil from pure light. 
* **The Grimwarden Crest:** Mere proximity to Kaldor’s family crest causes these beasts to grow hesitant or aggressive with fear.

## 💀 The Hollowed (Theory)
**Classification:** Undead / Construct
**Danger Level:** Unknown

*Note: Rumors from the Portalist Guild suggest that those caught in a "Screaming Portal" do not die, but are stripped of their essence, leaving behind a 'Hollowed' shell that serves the void.*
