# 🌑 Game Bible: The Age of Unearthing

## 🌍 World Pillars
* **The Setting:** High fantasy grounded in the "Age of Unearthing," where modern societies live atop the mysterious, dangerous ruins of the "Before Times."
* **The Portalists:** A powerful guild maintaining a "Web" of travel arches. Recently, the web has experienced "Screams"—audible magical distortions signaling a drain on the world's power.
* **The Filth:** A corrupting force found in the world's cracks. Those who make "Filth Pacts" gain power but are marked by a deathly touch.

## ⚔️ The Hero: Kaldor "Grim" Grimwarden
* **Heritage:** A lineage sworn to hunt the "Before Times" relics, specifically the **Collision Stone**—a weapon of war created when magic and dark magic collided.
* **Combat Style:** A 6'0" master of swords and knives who suppresses a potent, magical bloodline.
* **The Crest:** A bound family necklace that acts as a lethal deterrent to Filth-Marked individuals and burns anyone else who tries to touch it.

## 📜 Current Narrative State

* **Tension:** A Portalist named Zeph is reporting a "void" in the southern arch at the quarry. Kaldor's crest is pulsing, confirming a magical anomaly.
