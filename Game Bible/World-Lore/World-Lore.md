# The Age of Unearthing

## The World State
The world is a patchwork of rising civilizations built atop the ruins of a "Before Time." While not in open chaos, a sense of unease prevails as ancient magic begins to bleed back into the world.

## Key Factions
* **The Portalist Guild:** Controllers of the "Web." They maintain the blue-light arches that facilitate instantaneous travel between major hubs.
* **The Filth Pacts:** Shadowy groups or individuals who trade their humanity for power from entities residing in the world's "cracks."

## The Great Mystery
* **The Collision Stone:** A relic of immense power born from the clash of magic and dark magic. Its whereabouts are unknown, but its recovery is the primary objective of the Grimwarden line.
